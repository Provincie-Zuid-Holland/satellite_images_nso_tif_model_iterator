# Introduction 

This repository contains a .tif file (computer vision) model executer which means that it iterates and implements a (computer vision) model on every pixel and/or extracted image kernel in a .tif file.
As long as a model has a .predict function in python any model can be used in this executer from simple models to deep learning models.
For more on what image processing kernels are: [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing))

The iterative loop that loops over every pixel and/or extracted image kernel in a .tif, because of the long processing time, can be done in a multi processing loop, which in default this on.

Which means that it can't be run in a (jupyter) notebook interface, it has to be run from a terminal and it freezes your computer.


# Dependencies.
If you are a Windows user you have to install the dependencies via wheels. The wheels for the following dependencies should be downloaded from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/:

- [![GDAL>=3.0.4 ](https://img.shields.io/badge/GDAL-%3E%3D3.0.4-blue)](https://gdal.org/)
- [![Fiona>=1.8.13 ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fiona-%3E%3D1.8.13-green)](https://pypi.org/project/Fiona/)
- [![rasterio>=1.1.3 ](https://img.shields.io/badge/rasterio-%3E%3D1.1.3-blue)](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [![Shapely>=1.7.0 ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shapely-%3E%3D1.7.0-green)](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html)
- [![scikit-learn==1.0.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-%3D%3D1.0.2-blue)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [![NumPy==1.22.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/NumPy-%3D%3D1.22.4-green)](https://numpy.org/)
- [![geopandas>=0.9.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/geopandas-%3E%3D0.9.0-blue)](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/)

These should be installed in de following order: first GDAL, then Fiona and then rasterio. After these you can install the rest.

Download the wheels according to your system settings. For instance, wheel rasterio 1.2.10 cp39 cp39 win_amd64.whl is used with the 64-bit version of Windows and a 3.9 version of python. Install the wheel with pip install XXX.XX.XX.whl.

# (Image Processing) Kernels.
The main functionality of this repository is to extract image kernels and the multiprocessing for loop for looping over all the pixels and/or image kernels in a given satellite .tif file to make predictions on them.

The following picture gives a illustration about how this extracting  of kernels is done:
![Alt text](kernel_extract.png?raw=true "Title")


Here below we will have a code example about how this work. In this example we will use a Euclidean distance model to segment all the pixels in a .tif file into segments that are specified in a annotations file.

```python

from tif_model_iterator import tif_kernel_iterator

# This has to be run as a stand alone, so not in a python notebook.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Settings
    path_to_tif_file = "<PATH_TO_NSO_SAT_IMG.TIF>"
    out_path = "<PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FILE.shp"

    # The kernel size will be 32 by 32
    x_size_kernel = 32
    y_size_kernel = 32

    # Extract the x row and y column.
    x_row = 16
    y_row = 4757

    filename = "PATH/TO/MODEL/MODEL.sav"   
    loaded_model = pickle.load(open(filename, 'rb')

    # Setup up a kernel generator for this .tif file.
    tif_kernel_generator = tif_kernel_iterator.tif_kernel_iterator_generator(path_to_tif_file, x_size_kernel, y_size_kernel)

    kernel = tif_kernel_generator.get_kernel_for_x_y(x_row,y_row )
    kernel.shape
    #output: (4, 32, 32)
    # This .tif file contains 4 dimensions in RGBI 

    # Iterates and predicts all the pixels in a .tif file with a particular model and stores the dissolved results in the out_path file in a multiprocessing way. So this has to be run from a terminal.  
    tif_kernel_generator.predict_all_output(loaded_model, out_path , parts = 3)
```
# Installation.

Install the .whl file in the /dist folder.
